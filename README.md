# ADVISORY!

> [!CAUTION]
> Coonstrap is only meant to be my peronal resaerch and self-studies so it isn't meant to be used as it is. If you are looking for Roblox bootstrapper, Check out Voidstrap/Froststrap/Fishstrap (Google/DuckDuckGo/Baidu/Bing it by yourself).

----

Coonstrap is an experiemental third-party replacement for the standard Roblox bootstrapper which to be honest, It was quite barebone as Doraemon's feces.

Coonstrap is only supported for PCs running Micro$oft Windows obiously.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is this malware/crapware/trojan?**

**A:** No. The source code here is viewable to all (despite that this repo was forked for my self-taught WPF/WinUI Programming session) to keep things transparent.

**Q: Can using this get me banned/pwn3d?**

**A:** No, it shouldn't as this isn't even a bogus script-kiddie unlimited Robux generator nor speedhack engine fuckery so it's moot.

**Q: Dude, Why does it still has many reference to Bloxstrap?**

**A:** Well, This was a direct fork from that to make it more convinient for my intended usage purpose so it's not like Command+C Command+V plagiarise nor 1 to 1 carbon copy.
